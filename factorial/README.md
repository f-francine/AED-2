## Factorial

This program calculates the factorial of a given number. <br>
You will find inside each folder (application and entities) recursive and iterative versions of this algorithm. 

## How to run
- After you have cloned this repository, go until `factorial` folder, open your terminal/bash there and run the command:
`javac application/recursive/FactorialAPP.java` <br>
This command will generate a .class file, witch is a compiled archive in java.
Now, lets run our compiled program:
`java application.recursive.FactorialAPP`
And that's it! 

##### Note¹: 
_By default, this program is calculating the factorial of 3, so, the result shown will be 6. <br>
If you want to change it, you have to go until **line 9** of FatorialAPP program (application/recursive/FatorialAPP), and change the value of variable 
**entry** for the one you want._ 

##### Note²: 
_This is a step-by-step of how to run the recursive version of this program, but, if you wanna run the iterative one, you just have to change the `recursive` 
word used in the commands in the **how to run** section by `iterative`._
