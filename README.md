 Here you will find data structure exercises from Algorithms and Data Structure subject.
 
- factorial <br>
Program that calculates the factorial of a given number. It works both iterative and recursively.

- fibonacci <br>
Program that generates a fibonacci sequence as big as you want. There are a iterative and recursive version of this program.

- Sum Items <br>
Calculates the sum of each number inside a vector. Iterative and recursive version of it are avaiable.

- Sum Digits <br>
Calcutes the sum of the digits of a number. For example, if you entry `123` the result will be `6`.<br>
Only recursive version of this algorithm is avaiable.

- Linear Search list <br>
Search inside a given target inside a list, recursively.

- Table <br>
Generates a table of numbers and search a given target inside this table.<br>
There are two possible methods of search: binary and linear. Both of them are recursive.
